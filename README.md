Word vectors
Word vectors were induced from PubMed and PMC texts and their combination using the word2vec tool. The word vectors are provided in the word2vec binary format.

The word vectors are available for download from the following directory:

We also provide a set of word vectors induced on a combination of PubMed and PMC texts with texts extracted from a recent English Wikipedia dump. To get started with word vectors induced from a large corpus of biomedical and general-domain texts, download these vectors here (4GB file).
